This repository is for Assignment 5.1 - "Will a customer accept the coupon?" The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not.

## Findings
1. My conclusion on drivers who has higher chances of taking `Bar` coupons are:
* drivers who go to bar more frequently
* drivers who have passengers other than kids
* drivers whose income is relative higher

2. My conclusion on drivers who has higher chances of taking `Coffee House` coupons are:
* drivers who go to coffee house more frequently
* drivers whose destination is not an urgent place
* drivers who worked in building or health care
